# I-Can-Has
Java project from Fall 2016 semester.
A variation on Hare and Hounds. The player must move her hare (cheeseburger) to the other side of the board without becoming cornered by the hounds (happycat). Added a hardcore mode that makes it easier to lose. This was a group project, but all the code posted here is my own. Developed entirely in NetBeans.
